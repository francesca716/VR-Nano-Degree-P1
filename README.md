My name is Fei Sijia. I've spent about 4 hours to totally complete this project. I found that making the project by using the game engine Unity is very interesting, so I'm ready to learn the C# to make something more interesting and creative. Maybe writing the code is a challenge for me, and I failed a few times when I first tried to save the scene but then I solved the problem.
